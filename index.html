          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a critical tool in every web developer's toolkit.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>One of its core features is variables, which store data types as values.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, conditional logic and arrays can be applied to many other in-demand OOP languages.</li>
